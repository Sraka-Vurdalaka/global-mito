                      A Cookie is a small text file that a website, app, or other platform stores

                      containing information on your browsing and use, like a tag that identifies
                      your device. Cookies are necessary, for example, to facilitate browsing and
                      understand how users interact with platforms so they can be improved. They
                      are also useful to provide advertising according to user preferences, as

                      By “Cookies” we are also referring to other similar technologies used to

                      technologies for apps. The term “Cookies” also applies to the use of
                      fingerprinting, in other words, techniques used to combine information that
                      help us identify your device. These technologies sometimes run alongside
