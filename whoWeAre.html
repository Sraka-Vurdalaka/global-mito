              In the modern world, it seems that any knowledge is attainable. However, in
              practice, it becomes clear that with each passing period, obtaining true, accurate,
              and relevant knowledge is becoming increasingly difficult. AIs make mistakes, and a
              plethora of sources doesn't guarantee the reliability of the information they
              contain (who actually wrote this article: a doctor with years of experience or a
              teenage blogger)? Knowing those who know and having the ability to consult them is
              becoming an asset in a hyper-connected society. In response to these challenges, a
              group of experts* initiated the formalisation of an open, collaborative community of
              people interested in mitochondrial health from around the world and the creation of
              an open knowledge base in collaboration with them.

              The key result of Global Mito is the collaboratively created
              <strong>Mito Knowledge Base</strong> — a universal navigation map for professionals
              worldwide. Every session, roundtable, and networking activity is aimed at joint
              knowledge generation and tangible outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>
              We bring <strong>knowledge management (KM) technologies</strong> to Mito, enabling
              the effective collection, systematization, development, and application of
              knowledge. Knowledge management experts facilitate the collaboration of the Mito
              Community participants .

              One of the main results of Global MITO is the creation of the base for an
              intercultural expert community with a
              <strong>global virtual collaborative culture</strong> (GVCC). The principles of GVCC
              allow us to bring together diverse fields and create a compelling multi-stakeholder
              knowledge base. Each participant becomes a co-author of collective knowledge through
              exchange, co-creative initiatives, and projects. We integrate the principles of the
              <strong>co-creative culture</strong> from the GLINK summits (Global Leaders who
              Innovate Next Knowledge). It has been bringing together leaders from 30 countries to
              create innovation since 2017.

              Knowledge Management Global Network* (KMGN) – is a not-for profit network of
              international KM communities and associations that endeavours to connect KM
              professionals and facilitate co-creation and sharing of KM assets and resources.
              Founded in 2014.

              Vilavi International (global mito-industry business) took the initiative to bring
              together leading experts in science, practice, and business to systemise knowledge
              in mitochondrial health and medicine.
