            “Personal data” means any information or pieces of information that could identify you
            either directly (e.g. your name) or indirectly (e.g. through pseudonymized data such

            usernames, user generated content, sex, age rage, place of origin, user profile
            (journalist, consumer etc.). It could also include unique numerical identifiers like

            question); or<br>
            - Improve the functioning of our website (e.g. through satisfaction surveys).

            If you do not provide the data marked with an asterisk, this may affect our ability to provide the products

            When we send or display personalised communications or content, we may use some techniques qualified as
            “profiling” (i.e. any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of using those data to
            evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects
            concerning that natural person’s personal preferences, interests, economic situation, behaviour, location,
            health, reliability, or movements). This means that we may collect personal data about you in the different
            scenarios mentioned in the table above. We centralize this data and analyse it to evaluate and predict your
            personal preferences and/or interests.
